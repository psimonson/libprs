## PRS Library 2 v1.0 - (My Personal Library)

This library contains more than a few useful things for C programming. It's main features are simple unit testing framework, vector like std::vector<type> for C++, simple networking wrapper for Linux/Windows, simple debugging macros, and ncurses UI (for Linux).

### Notes

Ncurses UI - This currently will work with Windows. But future plans to add in a wrapper for pdcurses for Windows.

This library just makes redundant tasks easier like with networking, simple unit testing and debugging. Also, this library has C++ vectors in C. Will be adding more of my libraries as needed. The more I end up needing one of my libraries the faster it will be added in here.
